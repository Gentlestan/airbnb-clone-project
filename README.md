Airbnb Clone Project
This project is a frontend implementation of an Airbnb clone, developed as part of the ALX ProDev program. The goal is to recreate key features of the Airbnb platform with a focus on clean UI design, intuitive user experience, and responsive layout.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React (with TypeScript), Next.js, TailwindCSS

State Management: Redux or Context API

API Integration: REST

Testing: Jest

Backend (illustrative): Python, Django, MySQL (not the main focus)

UI/UX Design Planning
Design Goals
Build a clean, modern, and responsive interface similar to Airbnb.

Focus on intuitive navigation and visual clarity for a smooth user experience.

Ensure accessibility and ease of use across devices and screen sizes.

Key Features to Implement
Property Listings: Display properties with relevant details and images.

Booking System: Users can book, view, and manage reservations.

Search Functionality: Search based on criteria like location, price, and availability.

User Authentication: Secure login and registration process.

Importance of User-Friendly Design in a Booking System
A user-friendly design is essential in a booking system to reduce friction and enhance trust. Users should be able to search, explore, and reserve properties with minimal effort. Clear layouts, intuitive flows, and responsive feedback ensure users feel confident and in control throughout the booking process.

 Why Design Properties Matter in a Mockup
Identifying the design properties (like color and typography) of a mockup is essential for maintaining visual consistency and brand identity throughout the development process. It ensures that the final product aligns with the original UI/UX vision, improves collaboration between designers and developers, and leads to a better overall user experience.

## Project Roles and Responsibilities

- **Product Owner**  
  Defines the overall vision and roadmap, prioritizes features in the backlog, and ensures the product meets user needs and business goals.

- **Project Manager**

  - Implement responsive layouts, state management (Redux/Context API), and integrate with REST APIs  
  - Write unit and integration tests with Jest

- **Backend Developers**  
  - Design and develop API endpoints (Python/Django)  
  - Model and manage data in MySQL  
  - Ensure security, performance, and scalability of server-side logic

- **Designers (UI/UX)**  
  - Create wireframes, high-fidelity mockups (Figma) and design systems  
  - Define color palettes, typography, spacing, and interactive states  
  - Collaborate with developers for pixel-perfect implementation

- **QA/Testers**  
  - Develop and execute test plans (manual and automated)  
  - Report, track, and verify bugs; ensure overall quality and usability  
  - Validate cross-browser/device compatibility

- **DevOps Engineers**
